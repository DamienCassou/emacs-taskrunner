* Emacs Taskrunner
This is an elisp library which aims to provide a way to retrieve all of the
tasks/targets from various build systems and execute them in a comint buffer.

Currently, this project is in its very early stages and is not usable. The
ultimate goal is to use this library to provide an interactive interface through
helm/ivy/ido which will let the user select tasks and run them.
